# Compute Dirichlet-Selberg domains in the symmetric space $SL(3,\mathbb{R})/SO(3)$

## Background

This program is motivated by the PoincarÃ©'s Algorithm for the Lie group $SL(n,\mathbb{R})$ of non-compact type. This geometric algorithm aims to construct a polyhedral fundamental domain for the subgroup of $SL(n,\mathbb{R})$ with given generators, thus check if the subgroup is discrete and obtain a presentation from it.

Specifically, the corresponding symmetric space $\mathcal{X}_n = SL(n,\mathbb{R})/SO(n)$ is realized through a projective model:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{X}_n = \{X\in \mathbf{P}(Sym_n(\mathbb{R}))\mid X>0\}.
\end{equation}
